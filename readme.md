FlixMenu is basically an application which is meant not only to Digitize Restaurants
Menus, but to Automate the workflow going on within a restaurant. 

And when we talk about workflows, It is basically the activities done within a restaurants Organization and End Users which in this case would be the customers.

However, this workflow includes:
- Scanning of organization qr code to view the current restaurant menu.
- Viewing a restaurant's menu from your smart phone directly.
- Ordering of food within the digital menu right from your phone.
- Making it possible for organizations to add different food items within this menu.
- Viewing restaurant food categories.
- Making payments within this digitize menu into organizations.
- Realtime update from organization portal to digitize menu.
